## About The Project

This is a tower defence game I made in Java using AWT.
To run the game you just need the jar file if you have Java installed.
If you don't have Java installed but are on windows, you just need the exe file.
Both these files can be found in the Towers vs. Slimes folder. The Tower Defence
folder contains all the project files.
